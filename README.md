# CleanX
Easily clean your Laptop or PC without causing unwanted keyboard- /trackpad- or touch input.

#### Made with react-native.

## How it works:
It works by temporarily blocking any input that comes from your touchscreen, trackpad or keyboard for a set amount of time.

## Development status: paused
After finishing the frontend I noticed that it was an incredibly dumb idea to code a *Windows app* in react-native. I tried writing my own modules in C++, but that failed miserably. 

So I ended up with the decision to finalize the frontend and *not* code the backend. Instead I wrote a set of simple Python scripts that should do the exact same thing. 

I might code the backend in the feature when I expanded my skillset. 

## Contribution
If *you* want to code the backend, you are hereby invited to freely do so. 
Just fork the repository, make your changes and submit a pull request.
